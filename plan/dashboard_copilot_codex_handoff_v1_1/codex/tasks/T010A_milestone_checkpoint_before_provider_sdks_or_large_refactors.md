# T010A — Milestone checkpoint before provider SDKs or large refactors
Owner: QA/Test Engineer + Security/Privacy Reviewer

Goal: Prevent one-shot Codex execution from turning into an unsafe giant PR.

Target files:
- `qa/milestone_T010_report.md`
- `qa/challenger_closeout.md`
- `HANDOFF_INDEX.md`

Implementation notes:
- `Summarize files changed, commands run, tests added, product-contract checks, privacy checks, and rollback notes.`
- `Confirm explicit approval flags remain true before continuing.`
- `Do not install provider SDKs before this checkpoint passes.`

Acceptance criteria:
- `Checkpoint report exists.`
- `Baseline commands are reported with actual output.`
- `Entitlement route tests pass or blockers are documented.`
- `No forbidden persistence introduced.`
- `No provider SDKs, route split, AI coach, internal dashboard, or deployment-specific config has started.`

Tests:
- `No new code tests unless checkpoint detects missing coverage.`

Commands:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`

Non-goals:
- `No new feature work.`
- `No provider SDK installation.`

Dependencies: T010

Risk: High

Stop condition: Stop before provider SDKs, route split, AI coach, internal dashboard, or deployment-specific config unless checkpoint passes.
