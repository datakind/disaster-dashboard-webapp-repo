# Codex Task Backlog v1.1

Status as of 2026-06-14: this is the historical execution backlog for the
controlled-beta build. T001-T030 are implemented for local/reviewable paths,
and staging Supabase-backed magic-link login was previously user-confirmed.
Current `POST /auth/signin` can return `sent=1`; OTP resend cooldown is mapped
to `auth_rate_limited` after preview redeploy, and authenticated smoke still
needs a clicked magic-link session. Do not use this file as the next active
task list without first checking
`../qa/final_goal_status.md` and
`../qa/t031_staging_beta_validation_2026-06-14.md`.

Original execution rule: use tasks in order. The first milestone ends after
T010A so a human can review before provider SDKs, route split, AI coach,
internal dashboard work, or deployment-specific config.
