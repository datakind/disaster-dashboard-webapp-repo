# Final Goal Status

Date: 2026-06-28

Verdict: `LOCAL_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_PHASES_0_24_FORM_ROADMAP_VALIDATED`

The controlled-beta implementation is complete for local/reviewable code paths
through the phase 18-24 form roadmap expansion. The public deterministic demo,
protected-route login gate, session-only uploaded-data boundary, metadata-only
persistence boundary, deterministic fallback posture, protected repair guidance,
next-best-action coach behavior, metadata-only form registry, schema-only AI
interpretation, connector metadata validation, OCR/geocoding metadata
validation, and fuzzy review candidates have been locally validated. Earlier
Supabase-backed magic-link login was user-confirmed for the approved beta/admin
email, but authenticated staging route rendering and metadata/admin runtime
smoke still need a clicked magic-link session. Production credentials,
production migrations, production deployment, and production allowlist changes
remain out of scope.

## Completed

- T001-T010/T010A baseline, docs, env defaults, entitlement, AI route gating,
  usage meter, and checkpoint evidence.
- T006/T006A metadata-only schema, RLS draft, and server-only DB boundary.
- T011 Supabase Auth foundation:
  - invite-only magic link sign-in (`shouldCreateUser: false`);
  - pinned auth callback origin via `APP_BASE_URL`;
  - private/no-store auth redirects;
  - protected `/app/**`;
  - public deterministic `/demo`.
- T012 metadata DB adapter boundary:
  - approved metadata tables only;
  - in-memory test adapter;
  - Supabase adapter boundary with server-only client.
- T014 prompt/model version registry and safe AI event metadata guards.
- T013 DB-backed usage/event path:
  - `AI_USAGE_STORE=memory` default;
  - `METADATA_STORE=memory` default;
  - Supabase-backed store only when explicitly configured;
  - atomic `reserve_ai_usage` SQL draft.
- T015/T016 feedback API and UI:
  - authenticated route;
  - allowed tags;
  - comment length and row-like rejection.
- T017/T018 template API and builder UI:
  - private draft metadata;
  - owner-guarded update;
  - example row rejection.
- T019/T020 public demo plus protected authenticated app shell with usage meter:
  - `/` redirects to `/demo`;
  - `/demo` is deterministic and sample-only;
  - `/app/**` is protected by middleware and server layout.
- T021 route-backed workspace split:
  - `/app/data`;
  - `/app/prepare`;
  - `/app/readiness`;
  - `/app/dashboard`;
  - `/app/export`;
  - state remains in the mounted client workflow component, not server storage.
- T022 deterministic coach rail.
- T023 quota-aware AI coach augmentation:
  - auth/quota preflight;
  - atomic reserve before provider attempt;
  - strict step/readiness-only payload;
  - sanitized 1-3 hint response;
  - deterministic fallback on denial/provider failure.
- T024 admin metadata dashboard:
  - deny-by-default admin allowlist;
  - aggregate usage event count, fallback reasons, feedback count/tags, and
    template count;
  - no row/prompt/report display.
- T025 status endpoint hardening.
- T026 privacy guard tests for no row/file/prompt/response persistence.
- T027 deployment smoke checklist and dry-run script.
- T028 retention policy draft.
- T029 release readiness checklist.
- T030 final command and browser smoke sweep.
- Phase 13 form-aware disaster intake:
  - deterministic HXL, 3W/5W-style, and XLSForm-like metadata detection;
  - session-only form mapping into existing evidence coverage and readiness;
  - safe form metadata in handoff exports;
  - no form-response persistence.
- Phase 14 decision assurance product-standout layer:
  - decision playbooks;
  - evidence readiness control tower;
  - AI guardrail explainer;
  - Handoff Dossier v2 metadata fields;
  - safe beta learning signal helper;
  - protected internal `/app/ai-trial` sample-only AI-path smoke surface.
- Phase 15 session-only repair foundation:
  - typed `RepairAction` contracts;
  - deterministic repair action generation for missing evidence, ambiguous
    mapping, AI fallback, and quality review states;
  - no new persistence, provider, public route, or demo upload behavior.
- Phase 16 deterministic Next Best Action Coach:
  - ranks repair actions before generic hints;
  - returns 1-3 lowest-effort next actions;
  - separates app-assisted actions from human review.
- Phase 17 protected repair UI integration:
  - repair cards render only inside protected workspace mode;
  - public `/demo` remains deterministic and sample-only;
  - workflow copy avoids operational approval language.
- Phase 18 metadata registry foundation:
  - metadata-only `form_registries`, `form_registry_versions`, and
    `reusable_mappings` contracts;
  - strict domain validators before persistence;
  - in-memory and Supabase adapter boundaries;
  - protected create/list/read API routes.
- Phase 20 schema-only AI interpretation:
  - dedicated `/api/form-schema/interpret` route;
  - deterministic fallback first;
  - auth, entitlement, provider preflight, quota reserve, safe AI event metadata,
    and response sanitization.
- Phase 19 additional repair sources:
  - weak form detection, connector sync, OCR/PDF confidence, geocoding
    uncertainty, and fuzzy mapping review actions.
- Phase 21 connector metadata surface:
  - KoBo/ODK/Google Forms metadata validators;
  - opaque connector refs and aggregate counts/status/caveats only;
  - no credentials, tokens, background jobs, or response row persistence.
- Phase 22 OCR/geocoding metadata:
  - OCR/PDF page/field/confidence buckets and caveats only;
  - geocoding provider/config, match counts, precision buckets, and caveats only;
  - no PDFs, images, OCR text, addresses, coordinates, place names, or extracted
    rows.
- Phase 23 fuzzy review candidates:
  - deterministic exact, near, conflict, and no-match review candidates;
  - not a cleaning transform and no automatic dataset mutation.
- D1-D7 approval alignment:
  - preview-only deployment path approved;
  - Supabase Auth/Postgres approved for the real beta project;
  - schema/RLS review before preview or staging migration;
  - named beta/admin allowlists only;
  - `AI_DAILY_QUOTA=20`;
  - deterministic sample-only `/demo` with no anonymous AI;
  - manual retention documentation now, no retention automation.
- SQL review hardening:
  - `reserve_ai_usage` RLS grant now matches the schema signature;
  - `ai_events` route constraint now includes `/api/coach`.

    runtime smoke, and direct staging DB row checks remain unverified until the
    clicked magic-link session is available.

  - bundled sample workflow reached readiness;
  - the evidence readiness control tower rendered;
  - the AI guardrail panel rendered deterministic authority / AI-not-used copy;

    browser-storage, DB mutation, or client-secret surface in the phase 13/14
    work.

## Remaining External Gates

- Click the latest staging magic link for the approved beta/admin email.
- Redeploy the branch preview, then verify OTP resend/cooldown returns
  `auth_rate_limited` instead of generic `auth_failed`.
- Verify authenticated `/app/usage`, `/app/templates`, `/app/feedback`, and
  `/admin` against the staging preview.
- Verify one safe metadata-only feedback write and one safe metadata-only
  template write in staging, then confirm aggregate-only admin reporting.
- No production migration was run.
- No production deployment was run.
- Production Supabase project configuration, redirect URLs, allowlists, and
  migrations remain blocked pending explicit production approval.
- Production Vercel environment variables remain blocked pending explicit
  production approval.
- Additional beta/admin users require explicit allowlist approval before being
  added.
- Retention automation remains blocked pending legal/product review.
