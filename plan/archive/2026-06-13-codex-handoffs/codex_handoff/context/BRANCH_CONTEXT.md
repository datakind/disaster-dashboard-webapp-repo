# Branch Context

Target branch: `001-decision-context-data-quality`.

Known current branch behavior from prior inspection:
- Next.js 15 / React 19 / TypeScript app.
- Workflow now starts with `brief` before upload/profile/recommend/validate/dashboard/export.
- Existing feature: response-prioritization decision brief.
- Existing feature: suggested collection template and CSV download.
- Existing feature: deterministic readiness statuses `ready`, `review_needed`, `decision_unsafe`.
- Existing feature: quality checks include decision metadata (`decisionArea`, `evidenceNeed`, `caveat`).
- Existing feature: decision caveats can propagate into dashboard chart rationale and export.
- Existing feature: `/api/recommend` uses minimized workflow context and deterministic fallback.
- Existing constraints: no new storage, no new packages, no unsafe automatic cleaning behavior.
