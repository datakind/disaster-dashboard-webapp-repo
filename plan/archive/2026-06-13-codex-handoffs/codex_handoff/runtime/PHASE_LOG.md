# Runtime Phase Log

Codex should append concise phase notes here.

Do not include secrets or real PII.

## 2026-06-12 GOAL_00-GOAL_07 execution

### GOAL_00 - Preflight
- Branch verified: `001-decision-context-data-quality`.
- Initial worktree verified clean before edits.
- Scripts verified in `package.json`: `lint`, `test`, `build`.
- Node observed: `v24.15.0`; repo pin in `.tool-versions` is `nodejs 26.1.0`.
- Data Analytics preflight found no saved source-routing preferences or semantic-layer registry, so repo-local code/tests were treated as the controlling source.
- Stop conditions: none at start. Completion blocker found: this phase log was only a placeholder and the one-shot goals were not evidenced as complete.

### GOAL_01 - Evidence coverage core
- Files changed: `types/decision.ts`, `lib/decisionContext.ts`, `tests/dataPipeline.test.ts`.
- Added deterministic `buildEvidenceCoverageSummary`, status labels, candidate confidence/rationale, caveat, and next-action output.
- Test red-team worksheet:
  - Test name: `maps fragmented sample datasets to response-prioritization evidence`
  - Purpose: prove fragmented needs/capacity fields map to required response-prioritization evidence without AI.
  - RED result: initial targeted run failed before tests because `@/lib/workflowExport` did not exist; after implementation, this test failed because it over-required `coveredCount >= 4`.
  - Expected failure reason: missing implementation, then overstrict test expectation for legitimate ambiguous fields.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS_WITH_FIXES.
  - Issues found: original count assertion treated ambiguity as failure.
  - Fixes applied: changed assertion to require all five evidence needs are either covered or ambiguous and none missing.
  - GREEN result: `npm run test -- tests/dataPipeline.test.ts` passed, 50 tests.
  - Post-green false-positive check: assertions verify concrete dataset names, columns, and no missing evidence.
  - Test name: `marks missing required evidence with plain next actions`
  - Purpose: prove missing affected-population and response-gap evidence produce plain next actions.
  - RED result: initial missing implementation failure.
  - Expected failure reason: no evidence coverage function.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none after review.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: cannot pass with an empty summary because it asserts missing count and exact evidence needs.
  - Test name: `marks ambiguous evidence when multiple candidates are similarly plausible`
  - Purpose: prove two plausible response-gap fields become `ambiguous`, not an arbitrary winner.
  - RED result: failed with `ambiguousCount` 0 before ambiguity threshold fix.
  - Expected failure reason: heuristic was too decisive.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS_WITH_FIXES.
  - Issues found: ambiguity threshold too narrow.
  - Fixes applied: widened same-confidence threshold to 0.18.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: verifies both competing fields are retained.
  - Test name: `builds evidence coverage without AI or recommendation state`
  - Purpose: prove coverage is pure/deterministic from datasets and decision brief.
  - RED result: initial missing implementation failure.
  - Expected failure reason: no coverage helper.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none after review.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts item order and candidate dataset IDs.
  - Test name: `labels evidence and readiness statuses for no-code review`
  - Purpose: protect user-facing status labels.
  - RED result: initial missing exports failure.
  - Expected failure reason: labels did not exist.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: exact wording is intentional because GOAL_05 requires these labels.

### GOAL_02 - Evidence coverage UI
- Files changed: `components/WorkflowComponents.tsx`, `app/styles.css`.
- Added `EvidenceCoveragePanel` before generic quality checks in Profile step.
- UI includes summary chips, text statuses, candidate dataset/field, missingness, confidence, caveat, and next action.
- Step numbering fixed: Template Step 1, Upload Step 2, Profile Step 3, Harmonize Step 4, Dataset review Step 5.
- Accessibility notes: panel uses semantic section/article structure, text status labels, and `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"`.

### GOAL_03 - Simulated fragmented disaster data
- Files changed: `public/samples/demo_needs_assessment.csv`, `public/samples/demo_population_baseline.csv`, `public/samples/demo_service_capacity.csv`, `public/samples/demo_quality_risk.csv`, `lib/fileParsers.ts`, `components/WorkflowComponents.tsx`, `tests/dataPipeline.test.ts`.
- Added `fragmented` and `quality-risk` sample kinds without changing existing `single`/`multi`.
- Added upload buttons: `Use fragmented demo data` and `Use risky quality sample`.
- Test red-team worksheet:
  - Test name: `loads fragmented and risky quality demo sample data`
  - Purpose: prove loader supports new sample kinds and files.
  - RED result: initial missing implementation/sample files failure.
  - Expected failure reason: loader only supported `single`/`multi`; sample files were absent.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none after review.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts exact filenames and risky invalid value.
  - Test name: `fragmented demo data produces multi-source evidence coverage`
  - Purpose: prove the public sample files produce coverage spanning needs, population, and capacity files.
  - RED result: initial missing sample files/coverage helper failure.
  - Expected failure reason: files and helper absent.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none after review.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts all three sample dataset names contribute candidates.
  - Test name: `quality-risk sample triggers invalid decision values and decision unsafe readiness`
  - Purpose: prove risky demo creates invalid-value findings and `decision_unsafe` readiness.
  - RED result: initial missing risky sample failure.
  - Expected failure reason: sample file absent.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none after review.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts specific invalid percent and negative count finding IDs.

### GOAL_04 - Decision handoff packet and fallback handling
- Files changed: `lib/workflowExport.ts`, `app/page.tsx`, `components/WorkflowComponents.tsx`, `tests/dataPipeline.test.ts`.
- Added `buildDecisionHandoffPacket` with decision context, evidence coverage, readiness, dataset lineage, join review, quality summary, transformations, AI assistance, limitations, and review notice.
- JSON export filename changed to `dashboard-copilot-decision-handoff-log.json`.
- Export UI label changed to `Decision handoff log`.
- Fallback copy now states AI unavailability and deterministic workflow availability in plain language.
- Test red-team worksheet:
  - Test name: `builds a decision handoff packet with evidence coverage and lineage`
  - Purpose: prove packet includes decision context, evidence coverage, and dataset lineage.
  - RED result: initial missing `@/lib/workflowExport` module failure.
  - Expected failure reason: handoff helper absent.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none after helper shape review.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts fields, rows, and evidence item count.
  - Test name: `handoff packet records deterministic fallback mode`
  - Purpose: prove fallback mode is explicit.
  - RED result: initial missing helper failure.
  - Expected failure reason: helper absent.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: none.
  - Fixes applied: none.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts mode and deterministic summary.
  - Test name: `decision unsafe packet includes review-only language`
  - Purpose: prove unsafe output is marked review-only.
  - RED result: initial missing helper failure.
  - Expected failure reason: helper absent.
  - Red-team verdict: PASS.
  - Issues found: TypeScript nullability needed a safer assertion.
  - Fixes applied: used optional access for readiness status assertion.
  - GREEN result: targeted suite and lint passed.
  - Post-green false-positive check: asserts review notice and limitations language.

### GOAL_05 - Accessible no-code UX polish
- Files changed: `components/WorkflowComponents.tsx`, `app/styles.css`.
- Copy updated: `Review before combining files`, `Review Combined Dataset`, `Decision handoff log`, and human readiness labels.
- Upload file input is no longer `display: none`; it remains focusable for keyboard users while visually compact.
- Tables touched in this pass include a caption.
- Privacy/fallback copy keeps sample/profile metadata caveat instead of claiming no data is sent.

### GOAL_07 - Final release pass
- Files changed: `docs/showcase-script.md`.
- Added 3-minute demo script, exact click path, main sample path, risky sample path, AI fallback path, limitations, and next steps.
