# Production Readiness Decision

Date prepared: 2026-06-29

Verdict: `PENDING_PRODUCTION_APPROVAL`

This is the pending production approval record for
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-29-product-review-roadmap-delivery.md`.
It is not production approval and does not authorize deployment, production
environment mutation, production Supabase configuration, production migrations,
provider/model/quota changes, admin policy changes, retention automation, or
persistence expansion.

## Current State

- Local Gate 1 and Gate 2 implementation evidence is recorded in
  `plan/dashboard_copilot_codex_handoff_v1_1/qa/product_review_roadmap_delivery_2026-06-29.md`.
- Staging evidence capture is prepared in
  `plan/dashboard_copilot_codex_handoff_v1_1/qa/staging_evidence_capture_2026-06-29.md`.
- Upload viability is approved at 10 MB per uploaded file in
  `docs/decisions/upload-viability.md`.
- Production readiness is blocked until explicit approval is recorded here.

## Approval Checklist

Production may be considered only when each item is reviewed and explicitly
approved by the required owner.

- [ ] Authenticated staging evidence is complete or explicitly waived with a
      named approver.
- [ ] Metadata-only feedback/template write smoke is complete in staging.
- [ ] Admin aggregate reporting is verified in staging without raw rows,
      prompts, reports, exports, or direct personal identifiers.
- [ ] Staging DB/RLS checks are complete or explicitly waived with a named
      approver.
- [ ] Production deployment target is selected.
- [ ] Production Supabase project, redirect URLs, and auth email flow are
      reviewed.
- [ ] Production schema/RLS migration plan is reviewed.
- [ ] Rollback path is documented.
- [ ] Admin and beta allowlist values are approved.
- [ ] `AI_DAILY_QUOTA` remains `20` or a new quota is explicitly approved.
- [ ] AI provider/model remains unchanged or a new provider/model is
      explicitly approved.
- [ ] Retention automation remains off unless legal/product review is complete
      and the user separately gives explicit approval.
- [ ] Persistence remains limited to approved metadata tables.
- [ ] Public `/demo` remains deterministic, sample-only, upload-free, and free
      of anonymous AI unless a separate public-demo decision changes it.

- production auth redirect smoke;
- production `/demo` public deterministic smoke;
- production `/app/**` unauthenticated redirect smoke;
- production authenticated app smoke with approved account;
