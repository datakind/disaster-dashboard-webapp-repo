# Release Readiness Checklist

This app is not production-ready until every gate below has an owner and a pass
record.

Current status as of 2026-06-29: the public `/demo` path is suitable for public
sharing as a deterministic, synthetic-sample preview. Supabase-backed magic-link
login has been user-confirmed for controlled-beta testing. Authenticated
workflow smoke has been exercised by the user, while metadata write smoke,
admin aggregate runtime smoke, direct staging DB row checks, and production
configuration remain explicit gates. Production deployment, production
environment variables, and production migrations remain blocked.

## Approved Beta Decisions

- D1: Use preview-only deployment first. Production remains blocked until auth,
  DB, and fallback smoke tests pass.
- D2: Use Supabase Auth and Supabase Postgres for the real controlled-beta
  project.
- D3: Review schema and RLS first, then migrate only in preview or staging.
- D4: Start with named beta emails and named admins. No open self-serve signup.
- D5: Keep `AI_DAILY_QUOTA=20` for early beta.
- D6: Keep `/demo` deterministic and sample-only. No anonymous AI.
- D7: Document retention now; automate deletion only after legal/product review.

## Product

- Public `/demo` remains deterministic.
- Authenticated `/app` keeps uploaded data in browser session state.
- Deterministic readiness remains authoritative over AI advice.

## Safety And Privacy

- No uploaded row/file/report persistence.
- No full prompt or full model response persistence.
- Supabase secret keys, database URLs, and LLM keys stay server-side.
- Feedback and template inputs reject row-like content.

## Auth And DB

- Supabase Auth redirect URLs are reviewed.
- Beta access is invite/allowlist controlled.
- RLS and grants are reviewed before any production migration.
- Usage reservation uses the reviewed atomic function.
- Complete the staging magic-link session before claiming authenticated beta
  smoke is current.

## AI Governance

- Every AI event has a prompt version.
- Quota increments only immediately before provider attempts.
- Denied, disabled, missing-key, invalid, and unauthenticated fallbacks do not
  increment usage.

## Deployment

- Preview smoke tests pass before production approval.
- `/api/recommend/status` reports safe public state only.
- `/api/usage` rejects unauthenticated requests.
- Production deployment and migrations remain separate explicit approvals.

## Rollback

- Disable AI with `LLM_ENABLED=false` and
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_COPILOT_API_ENABLED=false`.
- Keep `/demo` available as deterministic fallback.
- Revert provider-backed metadata store to `AI_USAGE_STORE=memory` and
  `METADATA_STORE=memory` if DB integration misbehaves.
